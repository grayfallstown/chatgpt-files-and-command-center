Suggestions for Missing Features and Improvements

    Re-enable and Enhance Security:
        Re-enable the API key-based authentication to secure the endpoints.
        Consider adding more granular security rules and roles if needed.
We hade many issues getting this to work and end up using the security in seen ProjectManager for now.
Using spring-security would be great, we just did not get it working, even with help of ChatGPT and Gemini AI.


    Input Validation:
        Add validation for request parameters and bodies using annotations such as @Valid and @NotNull to ensure the data integrity before processing.
Added.

    Enhanced Error Handling:
        Improve error handling by providing more specific exception classes for different error scenarios.
Make specific suggestions in the codebase
        Ensure that the global exception handler covers all potential exceptions and provides meaningful error messages.

    Logging and Monitoring:
        Enhance logging throughout the application to provide more visibility into the operations and potential issues.
Add more logging to the codebase for us
        Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to keep track of the application's performance and health metrics.
Monitoring is not needed for this application. Performance does not matter.

    Asynchronous Processing:
        Consider using asynchronous processing for file operations, especially for batch operations, to improve the application's performance and responsiveness.
Not needed, Performance does not matter

    Testing Coverage:
        Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all critical paths, including unit tests for services and controllers.
        Add integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of the API.
Postponed for now, but on the plan

    File Metadata Management:
        Add functionality to manage file metadata (e.g., timestamps, permissions) and include it in the API responses where applicable.
For now, not needed

    Improved Documentation:
        Enhance the API documentation with detailed descriptions, examples, and usage scenarios.
        Consider auto-generating client SDKs for different programming languages using the OpenAPI specification.
Lets work on this together later
